# Make a game

Target: a game that is **fun within 10 seconds of pressing play**, verified by playtest, in **under 30 minutes**.

**Time budget.** Run `date` at the start and at each step; if a step overruns, cut scope in the next one, never the verify or kid-check steps.

| Step | Budget | Done by |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Design | 2 min | 0:02 |
| 2. Scaffold | 1 min | 0:03 |
| 3. Core verb | 10 min | 0:13 |
| 4. Complete the loop | 5 min | 0:18 |
| 5. Verify | 4 min | 0:22 |
| 6. Kid check | 6 min | 0:28 |
| 7. Hand off | 1 min | 0:29 |
 Scope down before you polish up: one core verb done with great feel beats five half-done systems.

## 1. Design (~10 lines in your reply, then build)

- **Core verb** — what the player does every second (shoot, jump, slice, place, steer).
- **Loop** — verb → reward → escalation → fail/win → instant retry.
- **Base** — pick the closest starting point (`npm run new` with no args lists them):

| Idea shape | Start from |
|---|---|
| Anything 2D that fits nothing below | `--template blank` |
| Shooter, survivors-like, top-down action, many enemies | `--template topdown` (or `--from neon-swarm` for the polished version) |
| Platformer, side-scroller, runner | `--template platformer` |
| Turn-based, grid, tiles, logic, match-3, tactics | `--template puzzle` |
| Real rigid bodies: stacking, slingshot, golf, ragdoll | `--template physics` |
| Needs 3D | `--template 3d` |

- **Art & sound** — pick packs from the asset library (`assets/CATALOG.md`): e.g. animated characters from `mini-characters`/`graveyard-kit`, props from the matching kit, a Poly Haven texture/sky for surfaces, footsteps/impacts/voice from the sound packs. If nothing fits, `npm run assets -- add <kenney-slug>` (browse kenney.nl/assets) before falling back to procedural art.
- **Juice plan** — which feedback fires on the core verb, on reward, on damage ([game-feel.md](game-feel.md)).
- **Out of scope** — name what you're NOT building this session.

Ask the user only if the genre itself is ambiguous; otherwise pick the most fun interpretation and say what you picked.

## 2. Scaffold

`npm run new -- <slug> --template <t> --title "Title" --tagline "One line"`, then fill in `games/<slug>/GAME.md` (pitch, loop, controls) and `game.json` controls/color. GAME.md is the game's memory across sessions — keep it current as you build.

## 3. Build the core verb first

Get the player moving and the core verb working with feedback before anything else. Most of the work is the game's Play scene; menus, pause, game over, best score, level-up cards come from the kit (`menuScene`, `gameOverScene`, `enablePause`, `chooseCard`).
- Art + sound: the asset library via `kit/assets.ts` (models, animations, textures, skies, recorded sounds, sprite sheets) — see the Asset library section of AGENTS.md. Procedural `kit/phaser/textures.ts` / `kit/audio.ts` for abstract styles, effects and synth SFX. Feel: `Juice`.
- Every tuning number goes in the game's `config.ts` and through `tune(obj, 'Name')` so `?tune` shows live sliders.
- Systems to reuse rather than rewrite: `Director` (waves), `Upgrades` (roguelite picks), `Grid` (A*, flood fill), `Fsm` (AI/states), `Pool` + `SpatialHash` (>100 entities), `buildLevel` (ASCII levels), `TouchPad` (mobile).
- Add debug URL params as you go (`?god`, `?level=`, `?wave=`) so playtests can reach late-game states.
- Puzzle games: write a quick brute-force solver to prove each level is solvable before shipping it.

## 4. Complete the loop

Menu → play → game over → instant retry (R/Space). Score + persisted best. Escalation over time. Mute on M, pause on Esc (both free via the kit).

## 5. Verify

Done means all of:
- `npm run check` passes (a hook also type-checks after every edit).
- `npm run shot -- <slug> --gpu --seconds 20` exits clean, AND you read the screenshots and `__playtest` state shows the loop progressing (score rising, enemies dying, levels reached). Use `--eval` to force states the bot can't reach.
- Every item in [game-feel.md](game-feel.md) is present or consciously skipped.
- fps ≥ 55 in the `--gpu` run.

## 6. Kid check

Run the `kid-check` skill: find the 5 things a kid would say look wrong, stage a small tested fix for each (`npm run fixes`), and list them in chat so the user can say "fix 2" and get it instantly.

## 7. Hand off

Tell the user: how long the build took, `npm run play -- <slug>` (opens it), the 5 kid-check problems (numbered, kid-phrased, with "say fix 2 / fix all"), the controls, `?tune` for live sliders, what you tuned for fun, what you'd add next. Update GAME.md's Status and Ideas.
