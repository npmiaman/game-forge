## Rules for every game build

Whenever someone asks you to make a game in Claude Code, these two rules are not optional:

1. **Playable in under 30 minutes.** Run `date` when you start and check it at every step of the `make-game` skill against its time budget. If you're behind, cut scope (fewer features, one level, simpler art) rather than run over. Never cut the playtest or the kid check. Say how long the build took when you hand it off.
2. **Always end with 5 easy-to-spot, easy-to-fix problems.** Run the `kid-check` skill. Find 5 problems a kid would point out in how the game looks, each with a small (~10 lines) fix already implemented, tested, and staged in `games/<slug>/fixes/`. List all 5 in chat, phrased the way a kid would say them, so the user can say "fix 2" or "fix all" and have it applied instantly with `npm run fixes -- apply <slug> <n|all>`.

## Claude Code specifics

- **To build a game, use the `make-game` skill.** User slash commands: `/playtest <slug>`, `/polish <slug>`, `/ship <slug>`. Phaser API questions: the `phaser4` skill.
- A PostToolUse hook (`scripts/hooks/typecheck.mjs`, configured in `.claude/settings.json`) type-checks after every `.ts` edit and feeds errors back. Fix them before moving on.
