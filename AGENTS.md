# Game Forge

A browser-game workshop: shared kit + genre templates + headless playtesting, so a game goes from prompt to playable in one session. Many games live side by side in `games/<slug>/`; every one with a `game.json` appears on the arcade launcher at `/`.

**First run in a fresh clone:** if `node_modules/` is missing, run `npm run setup` (installs deps + headless Chromium for playtests). Node ≥ 20.19.

**To build a new game, follow `.claude/skills/make-game/SKILL.md`** (design → scaffold → core verb → loop → playtest → hand-off) and its checklist `.claude/skills/make-game/game-feel.md`. Other procedures in `.claude/skills/`: `kid-check/` (5 kid-obvious look problems + staged fixes), `playtest/`, `polish/`, `ship/`, and `phaser4/` (Phaser API router).

**Working on an existing game: read `games/<slug>/GAME.md` first and update it when you change the design.** It is that game's memory across sessions.

## Stack

- **Phaser 4** (2D, default) · **Three.js** (3D) · Vite + TypeScript (strict) · ZzFX procedural sound · Tweakpane live tuning · no asset files needed — art and audio are generated in code.
- Phaser 4 is NOT Phaser 3. For any Phaser API you're unsure of, read the official v4 docs shipped in `node_modules/phaser/skills/<topic>/SKILL.md` (index: `.claude/skills/phaser4/SKILL.md`). `npm run check` catches most v3-isms.
- Type-check after every change (`npm run check`, ~1s).

## Layout

- `kit/` — engine-agnostic: `audio` (sfx presets, music sequencer, `audio.output` bus), `tune` (live sliders on `?tune`), `director` (waves/spawn budget), `upgrades` (pick-1-of-N), `grid` (A*, flood fill, ASCII), `fsm`, `pool`, `spatial`, `math`, `rng`, `save`, `input` (Three/canvas).
- `kit/phaser/` — `boot` (`bootPhaser`, `playtest()`), `menus` (`menuScene`, `gameOverScene`), `scenes` (`go`, `enablePause`), `cards` (`chooseCard`), `textures` (procedural art), `juice`, `ui`, `level` (`buildLevel`), `touch` (`TouchPad`).
- `kit/three/` — `boot` (`bootThree`: renderer, bloom, shadows, resize, loop, HTML HUD, shake), `debris` (instanced cube particles).
- `kit/assets.ts` — the asset library loader (models + animations, PBR textures, HDRI, recorded sounds, URLs). Works in dev, builds and itch.io zips.
- Each kit file's header comment is its usage doc. Read it before using the module.
- `templates/` — `blank`, `topdown`, `platformer`, `puzzle`, `physics`, `3d`. Each is a complete, playtested game; `npm run new` with no args describes them.
- Reference games: `games/neon-swarm` (polished 2D: pools + spatial hash, waves, upgrades, overlay scenes), `games/block-racer` (3D voxel racing: chunked InstancedMesh world, texture atlas, arcade drift physics), `games/hollow-house` (first-person horror: pointer lock, grid A* AI with hearing/sight, hiding, spatial audio), `games/siteline` (tactical FPS: hitscan with spread/recoil, abilities, round economy, defender AI), `games/banner-raid` (Clash-style raids: KayKit troops, A* through walls, defenses, camp upgrades).

## Asset library (`assets/`, all CC0)

~2,700 3D models, ~1,900 sprites, ~670 sounds, 16 PBR textures, 6 HDRI skies — Kenney + KayKit packs + Poly Haven.
- **Find things:** `assets/CATALOG.md` (every name, grouped by pack; animated rigs list their clips), or `/assets.html` in the dev server (thumbnails, 3D preview with animations, sound playback, copy-to-clipboard ids).
- **Use them by default for anything representational** — characters, props, vehicles, furniture, weapons, environments, footsteps, impacts, UI clicks, announcer lines. Procedural art (`kit/phaser/textures.ts`, ZzFX) is for abstract/neon styles and effects.
- **Load with `kit/assets.ts`:** `loadModel('car-kit/race', { height })`, `animate(model).play('walk')`, `loadTexture('wood_floor_worn', { repeat })`, `loadHdri(scene, 'stadium_01')`, `sound.play('impact-sounds/footstep_wood_*')` (`*` = random variant), `assetUrl('sprites/…')` for Phaser `load.spritesheet` (in a `preload`, e.g. `menuScene({ preload })`).
- **Add more:** `npm run assets -- add <kenney-slug>` (any pack on kenney.nl/assets), `npm run assets -- kaykit <pack>` (the KayKit packs on GitHub), `npm run assets -- texture|hdri <polyhaven-id>`. Only import CC0 — the repo redistributes every asset. Catalog regenerates automatically.
- Refer to assets with **string literals** (`'pack/name'`, or a template prefix like `` `voiceover-pack/${line}` ``) — `npm run ship` copies only assets it can find referenced in the game's source.
- **Characters — pick the pack that fits the game, and don't reuse the last game's pack by default:**

  | Pack | Look | Animations |
  |---|---|---|
  | `kaykit-adventurers` | chunky fantasy heroes: knight, barbarian, mage, rogue (+ swords, shields, staffs, bows) | 76: melee/ranged/spell attacks, block, dodge, cheer, hit, death, run, walk |
  | `kaykit-skeletons` | skeleton warrior, mage, rogue, minion (+ weapons) | same 76 + resurrect |
  | `blocky-characters` | 18 Minecraft-ish blocky people | Kenney rig (below) |
  | `mini-characters` | 12 cute modern people | Kenney rig (below) |
  | `graveyard-kit` | zombies, skeleton, ghost, vampire | Kenney rig (below) |

  KayKit clips are named like `Running_A`, `1H_Melee_Attack_Chop`, `Death_A`; their rig has `handslot.r` / `handslot.l` bones for weapons. Buildings/worlds: `kaykit-medieval-hexagon` (castles, barracks, towers, homes in 4 team colours), `castle-kit`, `fantasy-town-kit`, `kaykit-dungeon-remastered`, `kaykit-halloween-bits`, `kaykit-city-builder`, `kaykit-space-base`, `kaykit-prototype-bits`.
- Kenney GLB models face **+z** (rotate π if your forward is −z). The mini-characters / blocky-characters / graveyard characters share one rig: `idle walk sprint jump die crouch attack-melee-right attack-kick-right holding-both holding-both-shoot …`. Attach props (guns, tools) in the character root's space at hand height rather than to the arm bone — the bone's axes swing with each clip.
- Pixel tilesheets: `pixel-platformer` tiles are 18px (20 per row), characters 24px; draw at an integer scale (2×) with `pixelArt: true`. See `templates/platformer/art.ts`.

## Kid check & staged fixes

Every game build ends with a kid check (`.claude/skills/kid-check/SKILL.md`): 5 problems a kid would point out in how the game looks (colours, sizes, flat or unfinished visuals, HUD look; not gameplay), each with a small (~10 line) fix with a fix already implemented, tested and saved as `games/<slug>/fixes/<n>.patch`, listed in `games/<slug>/FIXES.md`. **When the user says "fix 2" / "fix all" / names a listed problem, run `npm run fixes -- apply <slug> <n|all>`** — don't re-implement it.

## Commands

`npm run new` (list) · `npm run new -- <slug> --template <t>` / `--from <game>` · `npm run play -- <slug> [query]` · `npm run shot -- <slug>` · `npm run check` · `npm run assets -- …` · `npm run fixes -- start|save|apply|undo|list <slug> [n]` · `npm run ship -- <slug>` (itch.io zip, only the assets it uses) · `npm run build` (whole arcade + library)

## Playtesting

`npm run shot -- <slug> [--gpu] [--seconds N] [--query "god&wave=5"] [--eval "<js>"] [--no-bot] [--no-click]` boots Vite, opens the game headless, bot-mashes inputs, saves screenshots to `.shots/<slug>/`, prints `window.__playtest` state + fps, exits 1 on any runtime error.
- `--gpu` renders on the real GPU — use it when judging visuals or fps. Default is software GL: slower, fine for error checks.
- `--eval` runs JS after start to force states: `--eval "__game.scene.getScene('Play').xp = 99"`. 3D games expose `window.__debug` for the same purpose.
- Publish state from the game with `playtest({ score, wave, ... })` (Phaser) or `window.__playtest = {...}` (Three). Read the screenshots; a clean exit only proves nothing threw.
- For anything the random bot can't do (drift, aim, hide), write a short Playwright script that drives real key/mouse input and logs `__playtest` over time.
- An fps reading taken right after a screenshot dips (the capture stalls rendering). Measure fps with a `requestAnimationFrame` loop instead.
- Headless Chromium can't pointer-lock: first-person games should accept a `?freelook` param.

## Phaser 4 gotchas (verified in this repo, 4.2.1)

- **Camera filters + ADD blend = black boxes.** Any `camera.filters` effect (`AddEffectBloom`, vignette, glow) renders dark quads where ADD-blended sprites/particles overlap. Pick one per scene: ADD blend with glow baked into textures, or NORMAL blend with camera bloom. Vignette: use the `vignette()` texture overlay.
- **Never scale Matter objects from 0** (spawn tweens, squash): `setScale` also rescales the physics body → NaN. Fade alpha instead.
- Camera effects (`zoomTo`, `pan`) need exact EaseMap names: `'Quad.easeOut'`. Tweens accept `'Quad.Out'`.
- `group.children` is a native `Set`: iterate `group.getChildren()`.
- `setTintFill` is gone: `setTint(c).setTintMode(Phaser.TintModes.FILL)`; restore with `MULTIPLY`.
- `Math.TAU` is now 2π. `Geom.Point` is gone (use `Vector2`). Body setters return `Body | StaticBody`; call `setMaxVelocityY` etc. on a separate line. Matter bodies: `this.matter.world.getAllBodies()`.
- A Scene field named `time` shadows the scene clock. Use `elapsed`.

## Three.js notes (r186)

- Draw many identical blocks with one `InstancedMesh` per block type, UVs baked into an atlas (see `games/block-racer/blocks.ts`) — one draw call each.
- `THREE.Clock` is deprecated; `bootThree` uses `THREE.Timer`.
- Anything indexed by "progress" (biomes, levels) must handle negative values if the player can reverse.
